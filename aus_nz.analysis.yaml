  content: "This report outlines a comprehensive, logistical, and experiential framework\
    \ for a 15-day high-performance itinerary to Australia and New Zealand, specifically\
    \ calibrated for March 2026. The itinerary is engineered to satisfy the complex\
    \ matrix of requirements: academic engagement in Melbourne, high-volume daily\
    \ cycling (50\u201370 miles/day) on mixed terrain, hands-on maritime activities,\
    \ and a rigorous dietary safety protocol (Low Carb, No Nuts/Sesame/Zucchini).\n\
    \nThe proposed strategy utilizes a \"hub-and-spoke\" base camp model. Rather than\
    \ the fatigue-inducing \"grand tour\" style of moving hotels daily, this itinerary\
    \ establishes three strategic operational bases: **Melbourne** (Academic/Urban),\
    \ **Bright** (Victorian Alpine Cycling), and **Arrowtown** (New Zealand Adventure/Cultural).\
    \ This approach maximizes active time and minimizes logistical friction, utilizing\
    \ self-guided tour operators to manage the heavy lifting of transfers and equipment\
    \ while retaining the client's autonomy over daily scheduling.\n\nMarch is identified\
    \ as the optimal transition month for this expedition. In Victoria and the South\
    \ Island of New Zealand, mean maximum temperatures range from 18\xB0C to 24\xB0\
    C (64\xB0F\u201375\xB0F), providing ideal thermal regulation for endurance cycling.\
    \ Furthermore, the tourist density significantly decreases post-February, allowing\
    \ for a more exclusive interaction with trail networks and cultural sites.\n"

      \ zucchini is the ubiquitous low-carb substitute (e.g., \"zoodles,\" fillers\

    style: content
    content: 'In New Zealand and Australia, Zucchini is almost exclusively referred
      to as **Courgette**.


      *   **Action:** The client must use the word "Courgette" when communicating
      with staff. Asking for "No Zucchini" might lead to confusion or a false sense
      of security if the staff knows it as Courgette.

      *   **Steak Sauces:** Asian-fusion glazes.

      *   **Salad Dressings:** Tahini or sesame oil.

      *   **Low Carb Breads:** "Keto" breads often use sesame flour or seeds for texture.

      *   **Rule:** *No bread substitutes.* Stick to whole foods (meat, leaf vegetables,
      dairy).
