### The Sailing Capital of the World

Auckland isn't just *a* sailing city—it's *the* sailing city. Known as the "City of Sails," Auckland has more boats per capita than anywhere else on the planet. This is where the America's Cup has been defended multiple times, where sailing isn't a hobby but a way of life. We won't just watch from the sidelines; we'll take the helm of an **actual America's Cup racing yacht**, grinding winches and trimming sails on the very waters where legends have raced. For sailors like us who live for the feel of a loaded sheet and the thrill of a perfectly executed tack, this is a pilgrimage.

### Cycling Paradise: The Great Rides

New Zealand has invested heavily in creating the **Ngā Haerenga Great Rides**—a network of 23 purpose-built cycling trails that traverse the country's most spectacular landscapes. We'll ride through:

- **Ancient redwood forests** where towering California redwoods meet native New Zealand ferns
- **Volcanic lakeshores** with views of steaming geothermal vents and snow-capped peaks
- **Coastal vineyard roads** on Waiheke Island, often called "the island of wine"

With e-bikes, we get all the breathtaking scenery of a multi-day expedition with none of the grueling climbs—just pure joy on two wheels.

### Waiheke Island: Wine Country Meets the Pacific

Just a 40-minute ferry ride from downtown Auckland lies Waiheke Island—a Mediterranean-style paradise in the South Pacific. The island has earned international acclaim for its **Bordeaux-style reds**, particularly Syrah and Cabernet blends that rival the world's best. We'll cycle between award-winning vineyards, stopping for tastings with ocean views that stretch to the horizon. Think Riva del Garda, but warmer, wilder, and with better wine.

### Geothermal Wonders: Where the Earth Breathes

Rotorua sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, and the earth here is alive in ways that feel almost alien:

- **Pohutu Geyser** erupts up to 30 meters high, multiple times per hour
- **Bubbling mud pools** pop and hiss with primordial energy
- **Hot springs** heated by the earth itself offer the ultimate post-ride recovery
- **Steaming vents** rise from suburban backyards—this is normal here

The Māori have called this place home for over 600 years, and their culture is woven into every aspect of the region.

### Tongariro: The Volcanic Heart

Tongariro National Park is New Zealand's oldest national park and a dual UNESCO World Heritage Site (for both natural and cultural significance). The three volcanic peaks—**Ruapehu, Ngauruhoe, and Tongariro**—dominate the landscape with their dramatic profiles. Mount Ngauruhoe famously doubled as Mount Doom in the Lord of the Rings films. We'll hike through alpine tussock with these giants as our backdrop, or take to the skies for a scenic flight over crater lakes and lava flows.

## Trip Details

### Destinations

1. **Auckland & Waiheke Island** – harbour city + wine island + serious sailing
2. **Rotorua** – forests, lakes, geothermal areas, Māori culture, and Great Rides
3. **Taupō / Tongariro region** – lake town, Great Lake Trail, and volcano scenery

### What's Included

- Strong focus on **cycling and scenery** (lake, forest, coast, volcano views)
- A couple of **high-quality, hands-on sailing sessions** (not touristy cruises)
- **Moderate hiking only**, to protect knees but still see spectacular landscapes
- Good **food, wine, and cultural experiences** in a few well-chosen hubs

## Our Requirements & Preferences

### Travel style

- Prefer **1–3 base camps**, not moving every night.
- Want towns or small cities that are:
  - Walkable and pleasant
  - With **good restaurants** and some culture (museums, local history, Māori culture, wine).
- Not trying to tick off every sight; we’d rather have **fewer places, deeper experience**.

### Activity mix

#### Cycling (big strength)
- Both of us ride a lot; comfortable with **50–70 miles / 80–110 km** in a day, especially on **e-bikes**.
- Primary goal is **scenery and experience**, not racing or technical skills.
- Happy on:
  - Sealed cycle paths
  - Gravel roads and easy singletrack
- Want to **avoid**:
  - Downhill bike parks
  - Very technical, high-consequence MTB terrain (rock gardens, drops, exposure)

#### Hiking (knee-limited)
- Comfortable range: roughly **5–7 miles (8–11 km)** with **up to 1500–2000 ft (450–600 m) of elevation gain**.
- OK with a solid workout, but:
  - No 10–12 mile epics
  - No sketchy scree, heavy exposure, or “don’t trip here” sections

#### Sailing (high experience)
- We both own dinghies and race them frequently.
- We own and race a **35-foot keelboat** about **100 days per year**.
- We are **aggressive, hands-on sailors**, comfortable with loads, line-handling, and helming.
- We want:
  - **1–2 sailing sessions total**, but
  - They should be **real sailing** where we work the boat.
- We do **not** want:
  - Big 30–person sightseeing cruises
  - Trips where the crew does everything while everyone else drinks Prosecco

---

## Detailed Activity Plans

### Sailing Plan (Hands-On Only)

We only schedule **two sailing sessions**, both in the Auckland / Hauraki Gulf area, where the boats and conditions are most interesting.

#### Session #1 – America’s Cup–style race yacht (Auckland)

- **Operator example:** Explore Group’s **America’s Cup Sailing Experience**.
- **Boat:** Retired America’s Cup monohull on Waitematā Harbour.
- **Duration:** ~2 hours on the water (plus check-in).
- **Style:**
  - Professional crew runs safety and big-picture decisions.
  - Guests are invited to **hoist, grind, trim, and helm**.
  - Designed as an interactive “be part of the crew” experience, not just a harbour tour.
- Why this is worth it for us:
  - We get to play with a much bigger/faster rig than our own 35-footer.
  - Loads and grinders are real; it’s physically engaging and fun.
  - Short enough to fit into an Auckland city day without dominating the schedule.

This is our **primary must-do sail**.

#### Session #2 – Private Hauraki Gulf day charter *or* twilight race

We can choose one of two paths depending on how much time we want to allocate to sailing vs. cycling:

**Option A – Private Hauraki Gulf day charter**

- **Boat:** 35–45 foot monohull or catamaran, chartered just for us plus one skipper.
- **Example providers:** Classic Boat Charter, Terra & Tide, or similar outfits running private day sails in the Hauraki Gulf.
- **Duration:** 1 full day (roughly 6–8 hours on the water).
- **Style:**
  - We explicitly tell the operator:
    - “We race a 35’ keelboat 100 days/year; we’re happy with all the work. We’d like you for local knowledge and safety, but we want to **sail the boat**.”
  - The skipper can then focus on routing, traffic, and Gulf-specific quirks while we helm and trim.
  - Easy to incorporate:
    - A lunch stop at an island
    - A short beach walk or swim

This feels closest to our “Riva del Garda with instructor” experience, but at sea.

**Option B – Twilight or club race night**

- Alternative if we want to **protect daytime for riding**:
  - Use local crew lists / yacht clubs to join a **midweek twilight race** as visiting crew.
  - Expect a 2–3 hour evening race around the cans and a drink at the club afterward.
- This gives us:
  - A true “local racing” flavor.
  - Minimal interruption to the daytime cycling schedule.

For planning purposes, we can treat Option A as the **default** and Option B as a **maybe**, depending on how we feel once we see the overall calendar.

### Cycling Plan – Key Rides

#### Waiheke Island – e-bike wine-and-bays loop

- **Core idea:** Use **eRide Waiheke** or similar hire shop right at the Matiatia ferry terminal, and ride their curated **“5 Bays Ride”** on the northern side of the island.
- **Distance:** ~25–30 km (15–20 mi), adjustable with extra detours.
- **Surface:** Mostly sealed roads and some cycle lanes, with hills flattened by e-bikes.
- **Highlights:**
  - Series of bays and beaches
  - Vineyards and tasting rooms
  - Coastal viewpoints and cafés
- Style: very similar in spirit to **Riva del Garda “scenic loop + good food”**, just with ocean instead of alpine lake.

#### Rotorua – Whakarewarewa Forest Loop (Great Ride)

- **Route:** The **Whakarewarewa Forest Loop**, an official Ngā Haerenga New Zealand Cycle Trail **Great Ride**.
- **Distance:** ~33 km (20 mi) loop.
- **Grade:** Mostly Grade 2 (easy) with some Grade 3 (intermediate) sections.
- **Surface:** Gravel and pumice singletrack, undulating but not extreme.
- **Bike hire:** E-mountain bikes widely available from multiple rental outfits in Rotorua.
- **Designed for:** Confident riders of most abilities; very popular on **e-bikes**.
- **Highlights:**
  - Native forest and redwoods
  - Lakes and lookouts
  - Māori carvings and interpretation panels
  - Cafés and optional hot tubs nearby

With our cycling base fitness and e-bikes, this should feel like a **fun 3–4 hour ride**, not a sufferfest.

#### Taupō – Great Lake Trail (Great Ride)

- **Route:** The **Great Lake Trail**, another official Great Ride on the western shores of Lake Taupō.
- **Structure:** A series of sections (Orakau, K2K, W2K, Waihaha/Waihora) along Lake Taupō’s western shore.
- **Distance:** We can choose sections to hit **40–70 km (25–45 mi)** in a day, supported by shuttles and water taxi transfers.
- **Grade:** Generally Grade 3 (intermediate) – more about length and rolling terrain than technical stunts.
- **Surface:** Lakeside singletrack and gravel, with short climbs and descents.
- **Logistics:** Local operators in Taupō (e.g. Great Lake Trail shuttles and boat services) run transport and can help with route planning and bike hire.
- **Highlights:**
  - Big lake and volcano views
  - Bush, cliffs, and inlets
  - Quiet feel compared with busier tourist areas

With e-bikes and our background, this is an ideal long scenic day ride. We can decide on exact sections once we see current shuttle timetables.

#### Easy/bonus rides

To fill shorter windows or “active recovery” days, there are easier rides:

- **Taupō – Great Lake Pathway (Lion’s Walk):**
  - Lakeside shared path of ~10–13 km along Lake Taupō’s waterfront.
  - Grade 1 (very easy), mostly flat, with lots of spots to stop for coffee, ice cream, or a swim.
  - Perfect for an evening spin or a short, scenery-first ride.

- **Rotorua – family-friendly lake loops:**
  - Short 5–6 km loops around lakes like Blue Lake (Lake Tikitapu) or the Lake Ōkāreka walkway.
  - Very low risk, very scenic; good options if we want to walk or ride gently without committing to a big Great Ride day.

---

### Hiking & Scenic Add-Ons

We’ll keep hiking modest but still get a “wow” factor day in the mountains.

#### Tongariro National Park – moderate day from Taupō

**Target:** One moderate volcano day without doing the full 12-mile Alpine Crossing.

- **Base:** Taupō (day trip to Tongariro National Park).
- **Core hike:** Taranaki Falls Loop from Whakapapa Village
  - Distance: ~6 km (about 3.5–4 mi)
  - Elevation gain: modest (well under our 1500–2000 ft limit)
  - Scenery: waterfall, gorge, open tussock with big views of Ruapehu/Ngauruhoe on a clear day.
- **Optional extension:**
  - Continue up the Tama Lakes track for additional distance and elevation.
  - Out-and-back — we can turn around whenever we’re at our comfort limit.
  - Aim to keep the total around **5–7 miles / 8–11 km**, and within our elevation budget.

This gives us a **legitimate mountain day** that still respects the knee and doesn’t blow up the rest of the trip.

#### Tongariro / Taupō scenic flight (minimum effort, maximum views)

If we want the full volcanic drama **without** extra knee load:

- **Short scenic flights** (small plane, helicopter, or floatplane) from Taupō:
  - Typically 30–50 minutes.
  - Fly over Lake Taupō, Tongariro volcanoes, craters, and alpine lakes.
- We can pair this with either:
  - A shorter walk that day, or
  - A full rest day for legs.

This is a strong candidate for a “splurge” scenic experience, especially if weather cooperates.

---

### Timing

**Southern hemisphere summer (December–March)** — warm days, long evenings, perfect for cycling and sailing.
